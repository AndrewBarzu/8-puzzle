# 8-puzzle

This is my first try at a bigger C++ project, in which I tried to use mostly self made data structures (with exceptions for the
unordered set)

For now, It can only do a depth-first and a breadth-first search, and only outputs the number of iterations until it finds a solution.
I plan on expanding it to also show the found path to a solution, as well as implementing an A* search and a Dijkstra search, with a 
function for costs (I'll see what i can think of for the cost)

This was just made for fun to check which of the searches finds a solution faster.
